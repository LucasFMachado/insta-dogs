# InstaDogs
  
> This project was developed along the entire course of ReactJS by Origamid (https://www.origamid.com/curso/react-completo), where its proposal would be to develop a social network for dogs, using as external libraries only react-router (for application routes) and victory (for application graphics).

> In the project, it is possible to follow the users' posts feed, and comment on their photos.It is also possible to register and publish your own photos and follow the statistics of views of your posts.

> For the application backend, a ready-made API was used, where it is reset in a time interval.

> For all styling and animations in the application, only pure CSS was used.
